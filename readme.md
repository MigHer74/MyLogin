# Project "My Login"

## Description
"My Login" is a project that I wanted to use for hashing password using python bcrypt library, in order to do that I created a graphical user interface using ttkbootstrap library.

The project is form by a main window contains the classical entry fields for user name and password, a button to verify the password and a button to close the window.

Plus there is a button that opens a secondary window where are store the user data such as id, name and password.

On the secondary window can manage the users and here is where the app uses bcrypt to encrypt the password.

Finally, if the user name and password are correct the app shows a succesful access message if not,  it shows an error message.

This little project is going to be a part for a larger project.
